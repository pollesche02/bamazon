# Install

`npm install console.log`

# Usage

`require('console.log')` and go about your day

# How it works

Simple, node will stay alive until there are no callbacks left in the queue.  Assuming the application is not forcibly terminated (i.e. ^C, killall -9 node, etc...) it will run until all of the data passed to `console.log` has been flushed to the terminal
